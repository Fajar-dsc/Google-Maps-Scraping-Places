# Google-Maps-Scraping-Places

This is code for getting data via Google Maps or what we call scraping. The data I want to look for is data from self-storage companies in the Washington DC area. There are several possible data to obtain. This time I tried to retrieve some data including:

1. Company name
2. Latitude
3. Longitude
4. Location details


There are still some data that we can retrieve including business opening hours, ratings, and so on, but the 4 things above are the results obtained in this code. The running result of this code is a file in CSV format.
